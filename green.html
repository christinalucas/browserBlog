        <p>​<b>Problem</b><br>
            The community of Brantford needs to reduce their carbon emission in order to contribute to the fight against climate change.<br><br>
            ​
            <b>Process</b><br>
            ​We started by researching about what other communities were doing to reduce their emissions, how to reduce emissions, what Brantford was currently doing to reduce their emissions and behavioral economics to understand how we could get people to make a change. 
Next, we wanted to understand what Brantford residents thought about climate change and emissions. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 16 Brantford residents of a variety of ages. A resounding 94% of residents believed that climate change is real. Out of those people, however, many thought that a single person could not make a difference or they did not know what to do to reduce their emissions. We took the information gathered from our interviews to create a persona and journey map the steps the persona would take to try to reduce their emissions.  <br>
            <br>Throughout our design process we continually kept the user at the forefront of our designs and the decisions we made as well as keeping in touch with our client to make sure it aligned with the city goals.
            Once we understood our user's pains and needs we started ideating on possible solutions. Some of these ideas included a community competition, an advertising campaign, and events. In order to reach the most people and allow for continued use we decided to provide information in the form of a website. We designed the website using an iterative process which allowed for quick changes and user feedback. We had many pivots along the way in order to come to an optimal solution. These included a change in where the information would live and how the information would be distributed.<br>

        <p>​<b>Solution</b><br>
            While brainstorming how the user would find the website we stumbled upon something that gave us a Eureka moment. Drone fireworks! This led us to the idea of transforming the Canada Day celebrations in Brantford into a celebration of Canada as part of a bigger ecosystem. We came up with the idea of having a modular display which would inform people about emissions and climate change in a fun and inviting way. This would involve an emissions themed escape room, herb planting, raffle prizes and information cards which would lead people to the website. <br><br>

        <p>​We chose what would be included in the website based on what we heard from the users during our interviews.  This website will be incorporated into the existing City of Brantford website for familiarity and to gain trust from the users.  This incorporated an interactive map where users and the city could drop pins and post about their contribution to reducing their emissions. This would provide inspiration and ideas to others about what they could do to reduce their emissions. It will also create a sense of community. The website incorporates information about volunteer opportunities, events, awards and contact information to local businesses that could help reduce emissions. There is also a link to a website where you can calculate your carbon footprint.   <br><br>

    <p>​<b>My Angle</b><br>
            Finances, money and economic stability are all large sources of stress for many individuals (Davis et al.). Scotiabank seeks to relieve some of these stresses my making banking and managing your finances simple for a wide variety of people in a wide variety of circumstances. We set out to design apps and services that will relieve customer stress, make banking simpler and make the customer’s life simpler. We chose to focus on the automotive industy because that in itself can be a very confusing and stressful topic for many people and that combined with finances can be an extremely confusing and stressful situation. We chose to focus on this area because that coupling of stresses and confusion was something that Scotiabank customers needed a solution to. <br><br>
