    <h1>ABOUT ME</h2>
    <br>
    <p class = description> I started my academic journey in Biomedical Engineering where I learned the value of hard work and being detail oriented. However, I craved more creative freedom. During an enlightening co-op at Scotiabank I discovered UX design and knew that this was the career for me. I transferred to User Experience Design at Wilfrid Laurier University where I am currently completing my second year. I love to learn and canâ€™t wait to see where this journey takes me. In my spare time I like to paint, play tennis, sew and read.
