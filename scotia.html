        <p>​<b>Problem</b><br>
            Our client came to us with the task of creating a solution to retain a specific group of customers and to prevent the loss of these customers due to lack of awareness. The client proposed that a combination of targeting the wrong audience and at the wrong time contributed to the loss of these customers which was confirmed during the design process.<br><br>
            
            During the second week I was fully immersed into the collaborative and creative innovation design space with the Google Venture Design Sprint methodology.<br><br>
            ​
            <b>Weekly Agile Sprints</b><br>
            Right after a Google Venture Design sprint we hit the ground running iterating on the prototype from the design sprint and the user feedback. We worked in Agile weekly sprints which allowed for easy pivoting and quick iterations. Included in these weekly sprints were user research and user testing sessions. To say coming up with a final solution was an easy process would be a lie. There were many pivots along the way where our solution needed to change based on new information gathered. I quickly learned how much thoughtful consideration needs to go into creating the best user experience. I learned how to critique and receive feedback which is essential to the design process. <br>

        <p>​<b>User Testing</b><br>
            I was introduced to the importance of user testing and research. Three user testing sessions were conducted throughout the four months with a total of 20 participants. I was blessed to have had a fellow design co-op there with experience and passion for user experience research. From her I learned all about how to conduct user interviews, how to analyze results in an unbiased way and how to collect the correct information to validate or invalidate assumptions. <br><br>
            ​
            <b>Interdisciplinary Collaborative Work</b><br>
            Working as part of a team with data engineers, developers, project owners, and fellow designers has taught me how to collaborate effectively with others. The input of hard and soft feedback has shaped the results of the solution to reflect the needs of the bank, customers and other parties involved. The attending of regular meetings with the team, clients and stakeholders was critical for the alignment of the team and to ensure the designs being created reflected the work that was being done by the other members of the team. Being transparent and keeping the team up to date with what the designers were working on allowed for better team alignment and communication.<br></p>
            
            <b>​Solution</b><br>
            By the end of the four months we were able to present the functional minimal viable digital product to stakeholders and the entirety of Scotiabank Digital Factory in Toronto. This solution leveraged Scotiabank's existing partner network by improving connections with those partner networks and providing them with a solution to improve the retention of existing customers. The solution incorporated an onboarding experience that captured customers needs and wants and allowed the customer to be in control of the information they received. The solution is tailored to the customer by leveraging customer information held by the bank.<br><br>

        <p>​<b>My Angle</b><br>
            Finances, money and economic stability are all large sources of stress for many individuals (Davis et al.). Scotiabank seeks to relieve some of these stresses my making banking and managing your finances simple for a wide variety of people in a wide variety of circumstances. We set out to design apps and services that will relieve customer stress, make banking simpler and make the customer’s life simpler. We chose to focus on the automotive industy because that in itself can be a very confusing and stressful topic for many people and that combined with finances can be an extremely confusing and stressful situation. We chose to focus on this area because that coupling of stresses and confusion was something that Scotiabank customers needed a solution to. <br><br>
