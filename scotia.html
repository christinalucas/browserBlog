        <p>​<b>Problem</b><br>
            Our client came to us with the task of creating a solution to retain a specific group of customers and to prevent the loss of these customers due to lack of awareness. The client proposed that a combination of targeting the wrong audience and at the wrong time contributed to the loss of these customers which was confirmed during the design process.<br><br>
            
            During the second week I was fully immersed into the collaborative and creative innovation design space with the Google Venture Design Sprint methodology.<br><br>
            ​
            <b>Weekly Agile Sprints</b><br>
            Right after a Google Venture Design sprint we hit the ground running iterating on the prototype from the design sprint and the user feedback. We worked in Agile weekly sprints which allowed for easy pivoting and quick iterations. Included in these weekly sprints were user research and user testing sessions. To say coming up with a final solution was an easy process would be a lie. There were many pivots along the way where our solution needed to change based on new information gathered. I quickly learned how much thoughtful consideration needs to go into creating the best user experience. I learned how to critique and receive feedback which is essential to the design process. <br></p>
